**Debarment DB Search**

Place a file on your Desktop called clients.txt formatted like so:

Smith, John
Davis, Samuel R.

It will match on substrings, so less is more, you can always filter the returned results.  
The results will include the entire record, including address, so you can remove false matches, but adding a Middle initial when one doesnt exist in the Database will cause a miss, so less is more.
